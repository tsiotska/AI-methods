const trainingText = "For almost 300 years, a fictitious character by the name of John Bull has been used as a representation of the \" true Englishman\", as if the \"English\" were a homogenous race of people.\
    They are not. In reality, the English are among the more diverse races in Europe.\
    The \"Angles\", who gave their name to the country, were people from northern Germany, \
    who came over with the Saxons and the Jutes during the \"Dark Ages\", over 1200 years ago, \
     conquered the \"British\", who were Celts, and established their settlements. They were soon followed by Vikings,\
      from Scandinavia, who occupied a large part of eastern Britain. The last successful invasion of England came in  1066, when William the Conqueror, \
      duke of Normandy, defeated the English armies, had himself crowned king of England, and established a new Anglo-Norman state in which everyone important spoke French.\
    Since that time, England has never again been invaded or colonised by people from across the sea; yet in ethnic terms,\
     England has continued to evolve. During the Middle Ages, large numbers of men and women came to England from Flanders,\
      to work in the cloth trade; there were also Jews from Europe, who kept coming to England over the centuries. In the 17th Century,\
       thousands of French Huguenot Protestants fled from religious persecution and came to England, adding 1% to the total British population, \
       and considerably more in the south of England where most of them settled.\
    In the twentieth century, many more people emigrated to England: victims of Nazi and Stalinist persecution, \
    men and women from the Commonwealth, and workers from Europe. Most of those who arrived before 1960 took British nationality, and some of their children think of themselves as being English. Most consider themselves as British.\
    Thus it is clear that the English, Shakespeare's \"happy breed\", are a very mixed race.\
     There are few people in today's England, if any at all, who can claim to be pure ethnic \"Englishmen\" \
     (whatever that may mean.). It can be argued that there is indeed no such thing as an English ethnicity.\
    In political terms, the people who talk most about \"England\" and \"Englishness\" tend to be Conservatives or \
    on the political right; yet many Conservative politicians today and in the past have come from non-British backgrounds.\
     The most famous Conservative prime minister of the 19th century was Benjamin Disraeli; and two of the four senior\
      ministers in the Conservative government in 2020, Rishi Sunak (Chancellor of the Exchequer) and Priti Patel (Home Secretary), are of  Indian origin. \
     More surprisingly, one of the strongest voices on the \"English nationalist\" wing of the Conservative Party is a staunch Brexiteer with the name of Mark Francois, \
    whose mother was Italian.  Try understanding that."
